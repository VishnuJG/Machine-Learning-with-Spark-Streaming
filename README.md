  <li><b><h3>The second model i.e., Linear SGD Classification model accuracy graph</h3></b>

  <li><b><h3>The third and last classifiaction model i.e., Multinomial Naive Bayes model accuracy graph</h3></b>

  <li><b><h3>The KMeans Clustering model accuracy graph</h3></b>

  <li><b><h3>Comparing the accuracy of all these models together we get :</h3></b>

<h3>We can see that even though the Linear SGD model dips in accuracy in the beginning, it performs well when the batch-size is increased.</h3>

<h2> A similar graph for errors are also plotted together for better understanding the different models</h2>
